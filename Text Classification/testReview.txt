Feel free to disagree with me, it's your opinion and I totally respect it, but I loved this Remake of "The Lion King" and I'm not ashamed to say my opinion. I've seen it three times on the biggest movie screen possible and the experience was absolutely fantastic in all of them. Jon Favreau did a wonderful job recreating this story in a more realistic tone and style that really feels different than the original animated movie in a visual way, and that's exactly what he was going for here and I don't see a problem with him not wanting to change the story, after all if ain't broke don't fix it. Remakes and Reinterpretations will never stop and I don't mind them I'd there good, and this movie is great. The voice cast is excellent with terrific performances, especially by Billy Eichner and Seth Rogen who are both hilarious as Timon and Pumba, and Donal Glover as Simba who delivers a much better job than Matthew Bodrick in the original. The songs still just as amazing as they were before, especially "Can You Feel the Love Tonight" sung by Beyonc√© and Glover and the new version of "The Lion Sleeps Tonight". The visuals are remarkable and just absolutely gorgeous to see in IMAX 3D, it can be game changer to Visual Effects in Hollywood in all honesty. And the additional 30 minutes of runtime are barely even noticed personally. Again, feel free to disagree with me, but I really loved this movie. Is it better than the original? No, but it's not trying to, it's just trying to be a new interpretation of a beloved story like the Broadway show, and in that way the movie definitely delivers. See it and judge for yourself.
